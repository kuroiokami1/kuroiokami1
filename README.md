**ðŸ‘‹ Howdy! This Okami.**

I'm a 20 yo Linux enthusiast actually living in Argentina. I'm no good for programming, but rather just someone that likes computer stuff in general.

## Some little things about me

- ~i use arch btw~ I'm running an Arch-based distribution called ArcoLinux.
- I like video games, even tho I can't play nothing mid/high-end powered due to HW restrictions.
- I don't like poking into people's stuff, and I expect the same from social/web interactions.
